# A PHP CRUD app with MySQL

- This is a very Simple Application to show the absolute basics of a Log In/Log Out and CRUD(Create, Read, Delete and Update) app with PHP.

- To Use on your locallly ,clone this repo then edit connection ```connection.php``` to set up your MySql DB port and credentials:

- i.e. here  ```mysql:host=localhost:3307``` change to ```mysql:host=localhost:your_port``` e.g. ```localhost:3306```

- Using ```phpmyadmin``` create a database named ```crud``` , import the SQL file attached to create the db structure and dump data.

- That's it, get to testing:

- Sign Up, Log in and test out the crud features

- If you have trouble with Sign Up use the following details to log in:

- Username : ```Cozy``` Password : ```test```

- Styling has been done using online bootstrap4 CDN so you need an internet connection to load the Styles

- Check out the screenshots folder for a sneak peak:
